# User-Reviews-Vaccination-Centers-Berlin
Analysis of Online Reviews from users of the Berlin vaccination centers
### For questions contact: Stella Danek - stella.danek@charite.de

## Objectives of the Project
Using Online Reviews from Vaccination Centers to understand how users feel about vaccination centers, what dimensions and factors drives satisfaction or dissatisfaction and to derive factors for optimal vaccination center design.
Short overview of research questions:
* What are recurring themes, themes that affect users with relation to vaccination centers and the vaccination process generally?
* How do “concerns” of users change over time?
* What themes, factors and vaccination center characteristics are associated with satisfaction, i.e. a high review rating?
* How does satisfaction change over time?
* Which conclusions can be drawn for the optimal design of vaccination centers, but also for the vaccination experience generally?

## Vaccination Centers in Berlin
### Definitions
* A vaccination center (“Impfzentrum”) is “a location, normally used for nonhealthcare activities, set up for high-volume and high-speed vaccinations during infectious disease emergencies” , in Germany, vaccination centers are set up and operated by the federal states or on behalf of the federal states 
* In Berlin, the vaccination centers are coordinated and organized by the DRK SWB (Deutsches Rotes Kreuz Sozialwerk Berlin gGmbH, engl. German Red Cross social work Berlin non-profit company with limited liability), a non-profit company set up by the German Red Cross Berlin, the KVB (Kassenärztliche Vereinigung Berlin, engl. Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians) and SenGPG (Senatsverwaltung für Gesundheit, Pflege und Gleichstellung, engl. Senate Department for Health, Nursing and Equality ), since December 2021 SenWGPG (Senatsverwaltung für Wissenschaft, Gesundheit, Pflege und Gleichstellung, engl. Senate Department for Science, Health, Nursing and Equality) 
* In addition, a number of vaccination points (“Impfstation” or “Impfstelle”) were and are operated in Berlin; these are smaller compared to the vaccination centers and organized not by the Senate, but by the district offices (“Bezirksämter”), e.g. Impfstation Freizeitforum Marzahn or Impfstation Einkaufszentrum ALEXA
* The analysis focuses exclusively on the vaccination centers in Berlin

  * 14-day closing of Tempelhof 21/04/2021-04/05/2021 in order to install new cooling devices for BionTechPfizer’s Comirnaty 
  * closing of Arena and Messe from 14:00 on 06/04/2021 due to supply shortages of BioNTech/Pfizer’s Comirnaty vaccine

  * Booking: Until July 2021 vaccination appointments had to be booked
  * Walk-Ins: Since July 23 for Tegel, Messe and Erika-Heß and July 30 for Arena and Velodrom Walk-In vaccinations are possible
